    <h1>What is Matcha?</h1>
    <p>Matcha is finely ground powder of specially grown and processed green tea leaves, traditionally consumed
      in East Asia. It is special in two aspects of farming and processing: the green tea plants used for matcha
      are shade-grown for three to four weeks before harvest, and the stems and veins are removed during
      processing. During shaded growth, the plant Camellia sinensis produces more theanine and caffeine.
      The powdered form of matcha is consumed differently from tea leaves or tea bags, as it is suspended in a
      liquid, typically water or milk.</p>
    <p>The traditional Japanese tea ceremony centers on the preparation, serving, and drinking of matcha as hot tea, and
      embodies
      a meditative spirituality. In modern times, matcha is also used to flavor and dye foods such as mochi and soba
      noodles,
      green tea ice cream, matcha lattes, and a variety of Japanese wagashi confectionery. Matcha used in ceremonies is
      referred
      to as ceremonial-grade, meaning that the powder is of a high enough quality to be used in the tea ceremony.
      Lower-quality matcha is referred to as culinary-grade, but no standard industry definition or requirements exist
      for matcha.</p>

        <h1>Production</h1>
        <p>
            Matcha is made from shade-grown tea leaves that also are used to make gyokuro.
            The preparation of matcha starts several weeks before harvest and may last up to 20 days,
            when the tea bushes are covered to prevent direct sunlight. This slows down growth, stimulates
            an increase in chlorophyll levels, turns the leaves a darker shade of green, and causes the
            production of amino acids, in particular theanine. Only the finest tea buds are hand-picked.
        <p>After harvesting, if the leaves are rolled up before drying as in the production of sencha,
            the result will be gyokuro (jade dew) tea. If the leaves are laid out flat to dry, however,
            they will crumble somewhat and become known as tencha (碾茶). Then, tencha may be deveined,
            destemmed, and stone-ground to the fine, bright green, talc-like powder known as matcha.
            Grinding the leaves is a slow process because the mill stones must not get too warm, lest
            the aroma of the leaves gets altered. Up to one hour may be needed to grind 30 g of matcha.

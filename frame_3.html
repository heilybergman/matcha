        <h1>Traditional preparation</h1>
        <p>
            The two main ways of preparing matcha are thin (薄茶, usucha) and the less common thick (濃茶, koicha). Prior to
            use,
            the matcha often is forced through a sieve to break up clumps. Special sieves are available for this
            purpose, which
            usually are stainless steel and combine a fine wire-mesh sieve and a temporary storage container. A special
            wooden
            spatula is used to force the tea through the sieve, or a small, smooth stone may be placed on top of the
            sieve and
            the device shaken gently.
        </p>
        <p> If the sieved matcha is to be served at a Japanese tea ceremony, then it will be placed into a small tea
            caddy known
            as a chaki. Otherwise, it can be scooped directly from the sieve into a chawan.About 2-4 g of matcha are
            placed into the
            bowl, traditionally using a bamboo scoop called a chashaku, and then about 60–80 ml of hot water are added.
            While other
            fine Japanese teas such as gyokuro are prepared using water cooled as low as 40 °C, in Japan matcha is
            commonly prepared
            with water just below the boiling point, although temperatures as low as 70–85 °C or 158–185 °F are
            similarly recommended.
        </p>
        <p>
            The mixture of water and tea powder is whisked to a uniform consistency, using a bamboo whisk known as a
            chasen. No lumps
            should be left in the liquid, and no ground tea should remain on the sides of the bowl. Because matcha may
            be bitter, it
            is traditionally served with a small wagashi sweet[20] (intended to be consumed before drinking), but
            without added milk
            or sugar. It usually is considered that 40 g of matcha provides for 20 bowls of usucha or 10 bowls of
            koicha: Usucha, or
            thin tea, is prepared with about 1.75 g (amounting to 1.5 heaping chashaku scoop, or about half a teaspoon)
            of matcha and
            about 75 ml (2.5 oz) of hot water per serving, which can be whisked to produce froth or not, according to
            the drinker's
            preference (or to the traditions of the particular school of tea). Usucha creates a lighter and slightly
            more bitter tea.
        </p>
        <p>
            Koicha, or thick tea, requires significantly more matcha (usually about doubling the powder and halving the
            water):
            about 3.75 g (amounting to 3 heaping chashaku scoops, or about one teaspoon) of matcha and 40 ml (1.3 fl oz)
            of hot water
            per serving, or as many as 6 teaspoons to ​3⁄4 cup of water. Because the resulting mixture is significantly
            thicker (with
            a similar consistency to liquid honey), blending it requires a slower, stirring motion that does not produce
            foam. Koicha
            is normally made with more expensive matcha from older tea trees (exceeding 30 years), thus, produces a
            milder and sweeter
            tea than usucha; it is served almost exclusively as part of Japanese tea ceremonies.
